#Next Greater Element I
The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.


#132 Pattern
Medium

Given an array of n integers nums, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers nums[i], nums[j] and nums[k] such that i < j < k and nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j].

Return true if there is a 132 pattern in nums, otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,4,2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [-1,3,2,0]
Output: true
Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].
 

Constraints:

* n == nums.length
* 1 <= n <= 2 * 105
* -109 <= nums[i] <= 109


# Decode String

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4].

The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed 105.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"

Output: "aaabcbc"

Example 2:

Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"

Output: "accaccacc"

Example 3:

Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"

Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
 

Constraints:

1<= s.length <= 30

* s consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets '[]'.
* s is guaranteed to be a valid input.

All the integers in s are in the range [1, 300].
