# Multiset Operations

You are given an array A of size N. you need to insert the elements of A into a multiset and display the results. Also, you need to erase a given element x from the multiset and print "erased x" if successfully erased, else print "not found".

## Example 1:

```
Input:
N = 10
A[] = 9 8 7 4 4 2 1 1 9 8
x = 1

Output:
1 1 2 4 4 7 8 8 9 9
erased 1
2 4 4 7 8 8 9 9
```

## Your Task:

Since this is a function problem, you don't need to take any input. Just complete the provided functions. In a new line, print the required output.

## Constraints:

-   1 <= N <= 1000
-   1 <= Ai <= 106
